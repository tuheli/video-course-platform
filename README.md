## Fullstack Open University Course Project

This is an application I made for a university course project during summer 2024.

The idea was to build some core parts of a web application called Udemy which is a "videos-on-demand" web app made by a publicly traded company Udemy Inc. Udemy offers tools and help for creators to build video courses and sell them online.

One motivation to develop this app was my interest in learning to create applications capable of uploading and streaming video content for users.

During this project I learned a lot about programming complex and interactive user interfaces, css, ui component composition in a bigger codebase, video file format, amazon web services, sending large files in chunks and many more things. I have also learned a lot after this project especially regarding the use of material ui, css and building modular ui components.
